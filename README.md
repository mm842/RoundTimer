# RoundTimer

Simple program to run rounds and breaks with specified time. If there is a sound file "alarm_buzzer.wav" in the folder sound/, then this sound will be played after each break and each round. 

Note that the methods for the sound are depreciated and should be replaced.

## Motivation

I wrote this little program in 2010 to time rounds and breaks when doing sports at home. 

## Installation

Download the [.jar-file](RoundTimer.jar). To play a sound, the sound file has to be of .wav format and be made available as sound/alarm_buzzer.wav 
from the place of the .jar file. Unfortunately, I cannot provide a sound file at the moment. However, the program still runs without sound as well. 

To load and compile the source code an additional library info.clearthought.layout is required. Download the TableLayout.jar e.g. from here:
